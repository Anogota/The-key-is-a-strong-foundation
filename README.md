2.What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? It's also known as a console or shell. 

We need think about, for example where you turn on ur openvpn to start this machine, on distrubion Linux, the answer is terminal.

3. What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?
Witch out this u can't start your machine, this is a openvpn.

4. What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request? 
If you're not sure ur machine is working, how kind of tool you will use to test? the tool is ping.

5.What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target? 
I thing this is a most popular tool in CyberSec to scan ports, this is a nmap

6. What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans? 
We need to turn on the nmap, and check what's running on this port, here is how to do it:

For this test it will be enought, to check what we need in this example
The answer for the question is telnet 

7. What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password? 
I test some users, this will be a root, if u don't know try by your self some users until you will figure out 

8. Submit root flag 
We need to know log in as root, and get your own, this machine is little bit laggi, after few secend you will get access to login into the telnet
